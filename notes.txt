npm init to initialize the project
npm i express mongoose body-parser
npm i dotenv
npm install nodemon --save-dev
    nodemon is used to autorun the server, so that we dont have to restart 
    every time we make some changes, and --save-dev means its a dev dependency, 
    i.e. it is only for this system, other dependency are important 
    for the app to run anywhere.

"scripts in package.json"
    this is a feature provided my node.js, any key mentioned in scripts we can
    run it, by typing npm <key>, for exp, if we add a key, "abc" and give it a val
    "Im abc", then type npm run abc, it will try to run "Im abc".

    "Hooks" its a feature where, a predifined key is mentioned
    exp, start, as this is a hook, all we need to do is type "npm start"
    now this hook contains three keys, "prestart","start","poststart"
    using these keys we assign our desired files, and "npm start" will 
    execute them in order.

create .env file , which will have all the env variables defined
    like db url, port, db name etc 

create a folder config which will have config files, like db config, server config etc 
    inside it will export the config variables which it will fetch from .env using
    process.env, to ensure process.env uses our .env file 
    type require('dotenv').config() on top
    now we can use our config variables where ever we want 

index.js file
    create express app, import port and db_url from individual config files
    declare mongoose and connect to db, using async
    run the server on the defined port
